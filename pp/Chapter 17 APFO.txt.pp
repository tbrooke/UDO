Section 17.1 Purpose, Intent and Findings

17.1.1 Purpose and Intent 

To ensure that public facilities needed to support new residential development meet or exceed the level of service standards established herein.  

To provide a reasonable and realistic framework for the preparation of a capital improvements program needed to accommodate the town’s anticipated residential growth and development.  

To ensure that no application is approved which would cause a reduction in the levels of service for any public facilities below the adopted level of service established in this ordinance.  

To ensure that adequate public facilities needed to support new residential development are available concurrent with the impacts of such development, as defined in this ordinance.  

To establish uniform procedures for the review of residential development applications subject to the standards and requirements of this ordinance.    

To discourage suburban sprawl and to promote the small town character of China Grove as called for throughout the China Grove Planning Ordinances.  

To facilitate implementation of goals and policies set forth in the China Grove Unified Development Ordinance, any master plans for the provision of public facilities and services, and the capital improvements program.  

To ensure that all applicable legal standards and criteria are properly incorporated in these procedures and requirements.  

17.1.2 Findings 

New residential growth and development within the Town has an impact on the availability and capacity of the public facilities subject to this ordinance, which impact can be mitigated by the timing and sequencing of residential development as provided herein. 

New residential growth tends to create additional demands for commercial and non-residential development, and tends to occur before non-residential development.  In other words, non-residential development tends to respond to existing residential growth.  The Town’s policy is to encourage non-residential development subject to the design policies of the China Grove Planning Ordinances, which the Town Council hereby finds and determines will have the following effects: promote a sense of community, provide complete neighborhoods with a full range of services and civic uses, minimize traffic congestion by reducing the number and length of vehicular traffic trips, provide more efficient public services by accommodating more development within smaller areas of land, and promote economic development.  Further, the exclusion of non-residential development for the purview of this ordinance will minimize the number of applications for review, thereby enhancing administrative efficiency and improving application response times.  Accordingly, it is reasonable to apply the restrictions of this ordinance exclusively to residential development.  

  The Town has prepared and adopted a Capital Improvement Program (CIP) in order to provide the public facilities needed to accommodate reasonably anticipate residential growth and development.  The CIP will be updated from time to time to reflect changes in the Town’s residential growth rate, available financial resources, and other relevant factors.  

The level of services (LOS) standards adopted for each public facility in this ordinance are necessary for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare, and will not unduly inhibit new residential growth and development within the Town of China Grove.

Section 17.6 Methodology and Criteria for Determining Availability and Adequacy of Public Facilities 

Level of Service (LOS) Standards (Adequacy of Public Facilities)

Compliance with Level of Service (LOS) standards shall be measured for each public facility set forth in Column A of Table 1 that is applicable to the development proposal as set forth in Column B of Table 1.  The levels of service for each public facility are set forth in Column C of Table 1 below.  The LOS for each application for development approval shall be measured within the impact areas set forth in Column D of Table 1, below, for each corresponding facility in Column A.  Column E of Table 1 indicates whether planned capacity may be included in determining whether the improvements are available.   

Adequacy of Public Facilities

Each public facility within the impact area shall be deemed to be adequate if the demand generated by the proposed development is less than the available capacity.  Available capacity is calculated as follows: 

(Capacity + Planned Capacity + Advanced Capacity + if relevant, to the application, Reserved Capacity) minus (Utilized Capacity + Committed Capacity) 

Public Facilities Affecting Areas Outside of the Town and ETJ

Availability and adequacy of public facilities shall be determined only with respect to public faculties located within the incorporated areas and extraterritorial jurisdictions of the Town.  If the Town Council has entered into an intergovernmental agreement with Rowan County or with another municipality to evaluate public facilities in such areas, an applicant will be subject to the evaluation of the level of service standard for the facility as adopted by Rowan County or another municipality.    


Section 17.7 Capital Improvements Program (CIP)

Purpose 

The Capital Improvements Program (the CIP) is the mechanism by which the Town of China Grove provides new public facilities, and expansion of the capacity of public facilities, which are needed to accommodate existing and anticipated future population and employment.  Through the CIP, the Town intends to use all reasonable means to provide the public facilities and services needed to accommodate new residential growth and development, consistent with the availability of revenue sources, binding contributions for capital improvements provided by state or federal sources or applicants, and physical, environmental, or topographical constraints on the expansion of the capacity of public facilities.  The purpose of the capital improvements program is to evaluate the need for public facilities subject to this ordinance, to estimate the cost of improvements for which the Town has fiscal responsibility, to analyze the fiscal capacity of the town to finance and construct improvements, to adopt financial policies to guide the funding of improvements, and to schedule the funding and construction of improvements in a manner necessary to ensure that capital improvements are provided  when required based on needs identified by the Town pursuant to the Comprehensive Plan and/or other Town planning policies.  

Applicability to Permitting Provisions of this Ordinance 

It is the intent of this Ordinance that no development proposal shall be denied, nor shall any condition be attached to a development proposal pursuant to this Ordinance, unless an until a CIP has been adopted by the Town Council as provided herein,  

Capital Improvements Analysis Requirements  

The CIP shall be based upon the following analyses:

Current local practices that guide the timing and location of construction, extension or increases in capacity of each public facility.  

 The general fiscal implications of the existing deficiencies and future needs for each type of public facility.  This analysis shall be based on the needed improvements, as  identified by applying the level of service within each impact area, and shall address the relative priority of need among facility types; 

The costs of needed capital improvements for mitigation of existing deficiencies, replacement and new growth needs;

The basis of cost estimates; 

An assessment of the Town’s ability to finance Capital Improvements based upon anticipated population and revenues including: 

Forecasting of revenues and expenditures for five years;

 Projections of debt service obligations for currently outstanding bond issues or loans; 

Projection of ad valorem tax base, assessment ratio and ad valorem tax rate; 

Projections of other tax bases and other revenue sources such as impact and user fees; 

Projection of operating cost considerations; and 

Projection of debt capacity. 

Requirements for Capital Improvements Implementation   

The CIP shall contain: 

The five-year schedule of year-by-year capital improvements that the Town has accepted to reduce existing deficiencies, remain abreast of replacements, and to meet future demand.

 Project description and potential location.  

A list of projected costs and revenue sources by type of public facility for the five-year period.  

Requirements for Monitoring and Evaluation 

The CIP shall be reviewed on an annual basis, as follows: 

The Town Manager shall prepare a report describing the following:

The available capacity of public facilities, by impact area.

Anticipated increases in dwelling units and non-residential development within each impact area, based on population projects set forth in the China Grove Planning Ordinance or any subsequently adopted comprehensive plan.  

The need for any further public facilities, including the capacity of said public facilities, resulting from changes in population increase, employment growth, or other relevant factors and the population projections.  

The projected financing for any additional capacity resulting form the factors set forth in subsections i through iii, above. 

The Town Council shall consider the report prepared by the Town Manager and shall consider any appropriate amendments to the Capital Improvements Program.  


Section 17.8 Severability  

If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phase or portion of this ordinance is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by the final decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Ordinance.  The Town Council declares that it would have adopted this Ordinance and each section, subsection, sentence, clause, phase or portion thereof, irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, phases, or portions be declared invalid or unconstitutional.
