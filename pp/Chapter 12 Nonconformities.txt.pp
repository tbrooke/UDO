Section 12.1 Purpose and Applicability

The purpose of this Chapter is to regulate and limit the continued existence of uses and structures established prior to the effective date of this Ordinance (or any amendment subsequent thereto) that do not conform to this Ordinance. Any nonconformity created by a change in the classification of property or the text of these regulations shall be regulated by the provisions of this chapter.  Many nonconformities may continue, but the provisions of this chapter are designed to curtail substantial investment in nonconformities and to bring about eventual elimination and/or lessen their impact upon surrounding conforming properties in order to preserve the integrity of the area in which it is located and the intent of this Ordinance.  Nonconforming situations that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this Ordinance may be continued, subject to the restrictions and qualifications set forth in this Article.


Section 12.2 General Provisions for Nonconforming Situations

12.2.1 Extension or Enlargement of Nonconforming Situations
Except as specifically provided for in this Section, it shall be unlawful for any person to engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming situation.

A nonconforming use may be extended through any portion of a completed building that, when the use was made nonconforming by this Ordinance, was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use.  However, a nonconforming use may not be extended to additional buildings or to land outside the original building.

A nonconforming use may not be extended to cover more land than was occupied, or manifestly designed and arranged to be occupied, by that use when it became nonconforming.

The volume, intensity, or frequency of use of property where a nonconforming situation exists may be increased and the equipment or processes used at a location where a nonconforming situation exists may be changed if these or similar changes amount only to changes in the degree of activity rather than changes in kind and no violations of other paragraphs of this Section occur.

Physical alteration of nonconforming structures or structures containing a nonconforming use is unlawful if it results in:

An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use.
Greater nonconformity with respect to dimension restrictions such as yard requirements, height limitations, or density requirements.
The enclosure of previously unenclosed areas, even through those areas are or were used in connection with the nonconforming activity.

Minor repairs to and routine maintenance of property where nonconforming situations exist are permitted and encouraged.  Major renovation ‑ i.e., work estimated to cost more than 10 percent but less than 60 percent of the taxed value of the structure to be renovated may be done provided that the work will not result in a violation of any other paragraphs of this subsection.  In no case, however, shall work costing more than 60 percent of the taxed value of the structure be done, singularly or cumulatively, within any five (5) year period.

Provided, nothing herein shall prevent the maintenance, repair and extension of a single-family dwelling that is nonconforming as to use, provided done in conformance with the dimensional requirements of the R-M Mixed Residential District, nor prevent the maintenance, repair, extension, or construction of a residential accessory building or swimming pool, provided done in conformance with the requirements of this Ordinance.

12.2.2 Re-establishment of a Nonconforming Situation Prohibited
If a nonconforming use is abandoned for 180 days or more, the use shall not be allowed to re-establish.  All new uses in said structure shall thereafter be conforming. 

Any nonconforming building or structure or any building or structure containing a nonconforming use for which major repair or reconstruction is proposed in any amount equal to 60 percent or more of the taxed value of the building or structure or which has been damaged by any cause to an extent equal to 60 percent or more of its taxed value shall only be repaired and/or reconstructed and used as a conforming structure and a conforming use.

Nothing herein shall prevent the reconstruction of a single-family dwelling that is nonconforming as to use provided such reconstruction conforms to the dimensional requirements of the R-M Mixed Residential District.


Section 12.3 Nonconforming Uses

A nonconforming use may be changed to a conforming use.  Thereafter, the property may not revert to a nonconforming use.

A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another nonconforming use nor shall a nonconforming structure be replaced after it has been destroyed except upon approval by the Board of Adjustment. Such interpretation and finding by the Board of Adjustment shall follow the provisions set forth in Chapter 16.  

If a nonconforming use and a conforming use, or any combination of nonconforming uses exist on one lot, the use made of the property may be changed only to a conforming use.

Conforming uses, except Adult Oriented Businesses, may be established or re‑established in nonconforming buildings or structures provided that off‑street parking is provided as required by this Ordinance and provided no other provision of this Ordinance for the establishment of new uses is violated.


Section 12.4 Nonconforming Structures

12.4.1 Nonconforming Principal Structures
A nonconforming structure containing a use permitted in the zoning district in which it is located may continue only in accordance with the provisions of this section.

Normal repair and maintenance may be performed to allow the continuation of nonconforming structures.

A nonconforming structure may not, under any circumstances, be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity.

Should a nonconforming structure be moved for any distance on the lot upon which it is located, if possible, it shall be moved so as to make the structure conforming.  Otherwise the structure, if moved shall be placed on the lot in as conforming a manner as possible.

12.4.2 Nonconforming Accessory Structures
A nonconforming accessory use or accessory structure may be expanded only if the nonconforming features of that use or structure are not expanded so as to increase the degree of nonconformity.

No nonconforming accessory use or accessory structure shall continue after the principal use or structure is terminated by abandonment, damage, or destruction unless such accessory use or accessory structure thereafter is made to conform to the standards for the zoning district in which it is located.


Section 12.5 Nonconforming Lots

A nonconforming lot of record in existence prior to the adoption of this Ordinance, that does not meet minimum area or width requirements may be developed for any of the uses permitted by these regulations in the zoning district in which it is located, provided that the use meets all applicable yard, setback requirements for the zoning district in which the lot is located.


Section 12.6 Nonconforming Signs

Subject to the restrictions of this Section, nonconforming signs that were otherwise lawful on the effective date of this Ordinance may be continued.

No person may engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity of a nonconforming sign or causes a previously conforming sign to become nonconforming.

A nonconforming sign may remain if only the sign face is replaced.  The structure of a nonconforming sign may not be moved or replaced except to bring the sign into complete conformity with this Ordinance.  Once a nonconforming sign is removed from the premises or otherwise taken down or moved, said sign may only be replaced with a sign which is in conformance with the terms of this Ordinance.

Minor repairs and maintenance of nonconforming signs necessary to keep a nonconforming sign in sound condition are permitted.  If repair or maintenance of a nonconforming sign results in the removal of the sign frame structure for any length of time, the replaced sign frame structure and any copy placed on it shall be in conformance with this Ordinance.

If a nonconforming sign is destroyed by natural causes, it may not thereafter be repaired, reconstructed, or replaced except in conformity with all the provisions of this Ordinance, and the remnants of the former sign structure shall be cleared from the land.  For purposes of this Section, a nonconforming sign shall be considered "destroyed" if it receives damage to an extent of more than 60 percent of the cost of replacing the sign copy.

Notwithstanding other provisions contained in this Section, the message of a nonconforming sign may be changed so long as this does not create any new nonconformities.

If a nonconforming sign which advertises a business, service, commodity, accommodation, attraction or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered or conducted, that sign shall be deemed abandoned and shall be removed or brought into compliance by the sign owner, property owner, or other party having control over such sign within 30 days after the use has ceased operation or the service or commodity has ceased being offered.  If there is a change of use or name of business on a particular piece of property, and there were one (1) or more on-premise signs which advertised the business, any new signs placed for the new use or business name must meet all sign requirements for the underlying zoning district.  

If a nonconforming sign remains blank for a continuous period of 180 days, that sign shall be deemed abandoned and shall, within 30 days after such abandonment, be altered to comply with this Ordinance or be removed by the sign owner, owner of the property where the sign is located, or other person having control over such sign.  For purposes of this Ordinance, a sign shall be deemed "blank" if:

It advertises a business, service, commodity, accommodations, attraction, or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered or conducted; or
The advertising message it displays becomes illegible in whole or substantial part; or
It does not contain an advertising message.  (For such purposes, the terms "Sign For Rent", "Sign For Lease", "Sign For Sale", etc. shall not be deemed to be an advertising message except for billboards).


Section 12.7 Nonconforming Landscaping and Buffering

In accordance with Chapter 7 of this Ordinance, certain uses are required to provide screening and/or landscaping on-site.

Except as herein provided, any expansion of an existing use which is deficient in landscaping and/or buffering or any change in principal use cannot occur without the required screening and/or landscaping having first been provided on-site.  The Central Business (C-B) District is exempt from this requirement. 

Expansions to the parking area or loading areas which increase the total area more than 20 percent shall be required to comply with all applicable parking and loading area landscaping and screening.


Section 12.8 Nonconforming Parking or Loading

On any lot in any zoning district except the Central-Business (C-B) district, which contains a use which does not comply with the off-street parking and loading regulations contained in Chapter 8 of this Ordinance, a certificate of occupancy shall not be issued for any expansion or any change of use which would result in a need to increase the number of off-street parking and/or loading spaces required (except as herein provided), until the requisite number of off-street parking spaces and all paving requirements have been met.

A certificate of occupancy may be issued when there has been a change in a principal use and the number of off-street parking spaces required for the new use (per Chapter 8 of this Ordinance) is within ten (10) percent or ten (10) spaces, whichever is less, of the number of off-street parking spaces actually provided.  Such relief may be granted on a one-time only basis per lot or planned development.  In such instances where relief is provided, the additional parking spaces need not be paved (but shall have a graded gravel, crushed-stone or similar dust-reducing surface) if the parking lot prior to said expansion was not paved.


Section 12.9 Nonconforming Automobile Storage, Junk Yards, and Salvage Yards

Nonconforming automobile storage, junk yards, and salvage yards shall provide a Type A opaque buffer in accordance with Chapter 7 no later than one (1) year after the date of notification by the Zoning Administrator.


Section 12.10 Nonconforming Manufactured Homes and Manufactured Home Parks

Nonconforming manufactured homes on individual lots may not be replaced except with a use that conforms with all the requirements of this Ordinance for the zoning district in which located. 

Nonconforming manufactured homes may be placed and replaced in nonconforming manufactured home parks so long as the manufactured home park retains its nonconforming status, meets the requirements of Section 4.18 and Section 12.10 (c) below, and the space was designed and arranged as a manufactured home space prior to the adoption of this Ordinance.

Any nonconforming manufactured home park that is existing on the date of the adoption of this ordinance, or any amendment thereto, that fails to meet all of the requirements of this Ordinance, shall cease to operate and all manufactured homes and related structures in the manufactured home park shall be removed not later than five (5) years after the date that the manufactured home park owner is notified by the Zoning Administrator that the manufactured home park is nonconforming.  Such notification shall be in writing by the Zoning Administrator and shall be by one of the following methods:

Certified or registered mail;
Personal service; or
If the name or whereabouts of the owner cannot, after due diligence be discovered, the notice shall be considered properly served if a copy thereof is posted in a prominent location on the property and the notice is published once in a newspaper having general circulation in the Town.

The date the notice is mailed, served or posted and published, whichever is the effective notice, shall constitute the date of notification.  Certification of notice by the Zoning Administrator shall be deemed conclusive evidence of notification in the absence of fraud.  No other notice shall be required in this cessation process.

Notwithstanding the cessation requirements for manufactured home parks as set forth above, a nonconforming manufactured home park may continue to operate provided the manufactured home park meets one of the following conditions:

The manufactured home park may be reconstructed to meet all of the requirements of Section 3.6 and Section 4.18.  The manufactured home park shall be in an R-MH zoning district and shall be subject to the issuance of a Conditional Use Permit by the Town Council following the Conditional Use Permit approval process set forth in Chapter 9.  All reconstruction is to be done without extension or enlargement of the nonconforming situation.  This condition may be met at any time prior to the date of required cessation.

All nonconforming manufactured home parks will be given the option of subdividing the property into individual lots.  To be eligible to qualify under this condition the manufactured home park must be located within an R-MH zoning district.  Each individual lot must satisfy the lot size, lot width, setbacks, street access requirement, and all other requirements for subdivision within said zoning district.  Each manufactured home must meet all requirements set forth in Section 4.17.  Furthermore, no additional land may be used to meet these requirements.  No additional nonconforming manufactured homes shall be brought onto the property nor shall any nonconforming manufactured home be replaced at any time.  This option shall cease to be available upon the final date of cessation for manufactured home parks.

The manufactured home park may be reconstructed without regard to zoning classification, but shall be done without extension or enlargement of the nonconforming situation.  This condition must be met no later than 18 months after the date of notification by the Zoning Administrator.  If this condition is met, the manufactured home park will be allowed to continue as a nonconforming situation.  If this condition is not met by that date, the manufactured home park must either be reconstructed to meet the requirement of Condition #1, above, or cease to operate and all manufactured homes and related structures must be removed by the cessation date.  The owner of the manufactured home park submits a site plan and Conditional Use Permit application for review by the Town Council that meets the requirements for site plans as set forth in Chapter 10. The plan shall depict how the manufactured home park is to be reconstructed to meet the following minimum standards.  Prior to receiving a Conditional Use Permit, the manufactured home park shall have been reconstructed to meet these minimum standards:

Skirting manufactured specifically for underpinning shall be installed in accordance with the manufacturer’s specifications.  Skirting shall be kept in good repair.


Section 12.11 Nonconforming Adult Oriented Businesses

Any Adult Oriented Business that fails to comply with the use and locational requirements of this Ordinance but which was lawfully operating before the effective date of this Ordinance, shall not be deemed to be in violation of this Ordinance but shall be nonconforming.  Any such business which ceases active operation for a period of 30 days regardless of the purpose or reason shall be subject to all the requirements of this Ordinance and the property may thereafter be used only for conforming uses.

Any Adult Oriented Business lawfully operating as of the effective date of this Ordinance, but which subsequently fails to comply with the use and locational requirements of this Ordinance as the result of changes within the vicinity or amendment to this Ordinance, shall not be deemed to be in violation of this Ordinance but shall be nonconforming.  Any such business which ceases active operation for a period of 30 days regardless of purpose or reason shall be subject to all the requirements of this Ordinance and the property may thereafter be used only for conforming uses.
