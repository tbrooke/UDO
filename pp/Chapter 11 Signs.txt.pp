Section 11.1 Purpose and Applicability

The purpose of this section is to support and complement the various land uses allowed in the China Grove area by the adoption of policies and regulations concerning the placement of signs.  The outdoor placement of signs is a legitimate use of private property, but the erection of signs should be controlled and regulated in order to promote the health, safety, welfare, convenience, and enjoyment of travel on roadways, as well as protect the public investment in such roadways.  The provisions of this section are also intended to promote the reasonable, orderly, and effective display of such signs, displays, and devices.  It is also the intent of this section to prevent signs from dominating the visual appearance of the area in which they are located and to enhance the aesthetic environment of the China Grove area.
Except as otherwise provided in this Ordinance, it shall be unlawful for any person to erect, construct, enlarge, move, or replace any sign, without first having obtained a sign permit for such sign from the Zoning Administrator as required by this Ordinance.  A fee, in accordance with a fee schedule adopted by the Town Council, shall be charged for each sign permit issued.
