Garage doors are not permitted on the front façade of any two-family or multi-family dwelling unit.
Wherever possible, two-family (duplex) residences shall be designed in such a way that the primary entrances are not both on the same plane of the front façade.  Two-family residences are preferred on corner lots with one unit’s primary entrance facing one fronting street and the other units facing the other fronting street.
5.3.3 Manufactured Homes 
A manufactured home must bear a seal certifying that it was built to the standards adopted on June 15, 1976 that meets or exceeds the construction standards promulgated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that were in effect at the time of construction and that satisfies each of the following additional criteria:

Manufactured homes that are on individual lots not within a Manufactured Home Park shall be multi-sectional.  Single-wide manufactured homes shall not be permitted on individual lots.
The exterior siding shall consist of wood, hardboard, vinyl, brick, or similar material and shall be comparable in composition, appearance, and durability to the exterior siding commonly used in standard residential construction.

Variations in color schemes are encouraged in order to articulate entryways and public amenities so as to give greater recognition to these features. 
All accessory buildings shall be clad in materials similar in appearance to the principal structure.

5.4.1.1 Configuration
Roof pitches less than 3:12 and flat roofs shall require a parapet wall on all sides visible from the street.  Parapet walls shall fully screen all roof-top mechanical equipment from the street.

Section 5.7 Alternative Methods of Compliance

5.7.1 Use of Alternate Plan, Material, or Methods
Alternate design plans, building materials or construction techniques may be used when unreasonable or impractical situations would result from the application of architectural design standards. Such situations may result from unique site conditions, innovative design applications, and/or unified development design.

5.7.2 Evaluation by Technical Review Committee
The performance of alternate design standards shall be evaluated by the TRC to determine if the alternate design meets the intent and purpose of this ordinance.  This determination shall take into account the land use of adjacent property, the orientation of the building to public streets, the building typology, the intended use of the structure, attention to architectural detail, scale and mass.

5.7.3  Appeal
Decisions of the TRC regarding alternate methods of compliance may be appealed to the Board of Adjustment in accordance with Chapter 16.
